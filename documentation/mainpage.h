@section features Features

devLib2 adds features in several areas: PCI bus access, VME64x CSR/CSR,
and memory mapped I/O (MMIO) operations.

@subsection pcisec PCI Bus

The PCI bus access interface is entirely new.  It is currently implemented for
RTEMS, vxWorks, and Linux (with @ref pcilinux "some limitations").
The PCI interface provides functions for: searching the bus, mapping devices
into process memory, and (dis)connecting interrupts.

Runtime selection of implementations is also supported.
This allows code using this interface to compile and link for all target,
even those which lack an implementation.

@li @subpage pciusage

@li @ref exploreapp

@li @ref iocshpci

@subsubsection explorepci Generic PCI driver

The exploreApp @ref exploreapp is a generic EPICS driver intended to support
development of custom PCI/PCIe devices.
It provides a set of records which read/write to individual registers.
Basic support for interrupts is also available (Linux only).

@subsection vmesec VME CSR

The VME64x library provides several functions for accessing the CSR/CR
address space defined by VME64 and extended by VME64x.
This includes: probing by slot number and matching by identifier registers,
definitions of standard registers, and functions to access them.

/**

@page pciusage PCI Usage

When working with a PCI device the first step is finding the identifiers
used by the device.
These will likely be included in the card vendor's documentation,
but can be verified by observing the OS boot messages or with the devPCIShow()
function.

Including this identifying information in your code provides an important
safe guard against user mis-configuration.  This provides an easy way
to prevent your code from trying to access the wrong type of device.

PCI devices are uniquely identified by the triplet bus:device.function.
While it is possible
to automatically detect cards it is preferable to have a user defined
mapping between physical id (b:d.f) and logical id (Asyn port, device ID, etc.).
This allows for consistent naming even if cards are added or removed
from the system.

For EPICS drivers initialization will usually be done with an IOC shell
function.  For example:

@code
myPCICardSetup("dac", 2, 1, 0 )
@endcode

Would set card "dac" to be function 0 of device 1 on bus 2.
Since all PCI devices will be automatically configured by the system
this is the only piece of information required to access the card.

Below is an example implementation of myPCICardSetup().

@code
static const epicsPCIID mydevids[] = {...}

int
myPCICardSetup(const char* port,
               int b,
               int d,
               int f)
{
    volatile void* bar;
    epicsPCIDevice *dev;
    devpriv *priv;

    if( portExists(port) ) return 1;

    if (devPCIFindBDF(mydevids, b,d,f, &dev, 0))
        return 2;
@endcode

The first step is to probe the PCI location to ensure that the card is present.
If the location is empty or populated with an unsupported card then we will abort here.

@code
    if (devPCIToLocalAddr(dev, 2, &bar, 0))
        return 3;
@endcode

Next we get a pointer for bar #2.

@code
    priv=calloc(1, sizeof(mydevpriv));
    if (!priv) return 4;

    if (devPCIConnectInterrupt(dev, &myisr, priv))
        return 5;
@endcode

Then connect the interrupt service routine.

@code
    portCreate(port, priv);
    return 0;
}
@endcode

And that is it.

@section pciiotypes Note on PCI I/O Types

The PCI bus has the notion of two different I/O address types:
Memory Mapped, and Port.
This distinction comes from the x86 processor for which these are
two separate address spaces which must be accessed using different
instructions (load/store vs. out/in).

Each BAR must either be accessed using Memory Mapped I/O (MMIO),
or Port I/O (PIO) operations. This can be determined by inspecting
the 'ioport' member of the ::PCIBar structure.

If the value is false (0) then @ref mmio "MMIO operations" should be used.

If however, the value is true (1) then the pointer returned by devPCIToLocalAddr()
needs to be treated as a PIO address.  It should be cast to the appropriate type
and access using OS defined PIO operations (ie inb/outb).

*/

/**

@page vmeusage VME64 CSR Usage

When working with a CSR/CR device the first step is to find
the identifiers for the board.
This should be included in vendor documentation,
and can be verified by probing the appropriate VME slot at runtime.
The library functions vmecsrdump(lvl) and vmecsrprint(slot,lvl)
can be used for this.  See the IOC shell section for detail on
these functions.

Including this identifying information in your code provides an important
safe guard against user mis-configuration.  This provides an easy way
to prevent your code from trying to access the wrong type of device.

To initialize you must know its slot number.  While it is possible
to automatically detect cards it is preferable to have a user defined
mapping between physical id (slot#) and logical id (Asyn port, device ID, etc.).
This allows for consistent naming even if cards are added or removed
from the system.

For EPICS drivers initialization will usually be done with an IOC shell
function.  For example:

@code
myVMECardSetup("dac", 5, 0x210000, 4, 0x60)
@endcode

Would set card "dac" to be the card in slot 5.
This imaginary card is given an A24 base address of 0x210000,
and set to generate interrupt vector 0x60 at level 4.

Below is an example implementation of myVMECardSetup().

@code
static const struct VMECSRID mydevids[] = {...}

int
myVMECardSetup(const char* port,
               int slot,
               unsigned long base,
               int level,
               int vector)
{
    volatile void* csr, a24;
    devpriv *priv;
    if( portExists(port) ) return 1;

    csr=devCSRTestSlot(mydevids, slot, NULL);
    if (!csr) return 2;
@endcode

The first step is to probe the VME slot and get the CSR
base address.  If the slot were empty or populated with
an unsupported card then we would abort here.

@code
#if card is VME64
    CSRWrite24(csr + MYCSR_BAR_BASE, base);

#elif card is VME64x
    CSRSetBase(csr, 0, base, VME_AM_STD_SUP_DATA);

#endif
@endcode

Assuming the card supports full jumperless configuration then
then base address will be programmed using the CSR space.
While newer VME64x cards have standard base address registers
for this, older VME64 cards do not.
For these card the vendor should document the correct way to
set the base address.

@code
    if (devRegisterAddress("mydrv", atVMEA24, base, 0xff, &a24))
        return 3;
@endcode

Once the A24 base address is set we map it into the process'
address space with the standard devLib mapping call.

@code
    priv=calloc(1, sizeof(mydevpriv));
    if (!priv) return 4;

    if (devConnectInterruptVME(vector&0xff, &myisr, priv))
        return 5;

    if (devEnableInterruptLevelVME(level&0x7)) return 6;
@endcode

Always attach the interrupt handler before enabling interrupts.

@code
    CSRWrite8(csr + MYCSR_IRQ_LEVEL, level&0x7);
    CSRWrite8(csr + MYCSR_IRQ_VECTOR, vector&0xff);
@endcode

Neither VME64 or VME64x specifies standard registers for
interrupt level or vector code.  Vendor documention must
specify how to set this.

.Note
*************************************************
This may not be done in the CSR space, but rather
in another address space.
*************************************************

@code
    portCreate(port, priv);
    return 0;
}
@endcode

/**
@page pcilinux PCI Access in Linux

The PCI bus implementation for Linux uses the Userspace IO kernel API to access the bus.
Devices needing only memory mapped I/O access do not require a kernel driver.
To support PCI style interrupts a minimal kernel module using the Linux UIO framework is required.
Devices which implement generic interrupt enable/disable via the PCI control register
may user the generic 'uio_pci_generic' kernel module.
Otherwise this must either be written for each device to be supported.

@section shouldi When to Use

It is important to consider writing a full kernel module.
The advantage of the UIO interface is simpler development with access to userspace tools and safeguards.
Also compatibility with RTEMS and vxWorks.
The disadvantage is increased latency, being forced to be compatible with RTEMS and vxWorks,
and being restricted in use to EPICS code.

It is likely that devices needing low latency, high throughput, or access to features like DMA
would be better served by writing a full kernel module.

@section hwrequire Hardware Requirements

When servicing interrupts from a userspace process it is not possible to globally
disable interrupts.  Thus it is not possible to rely on epicsInterruptLock()
when accessing resources which must be shared between kernel and user-space.

This makes it difficult to perform read-modify-write operations
on shared registers.  This can be an intractable problem
for a device which implements its interrupt enable register as a bit mask.

When evaluating hardware for the suitability look for an
interrupt mask register and status register.

This should not be an issue for devices having a single interrupt condition.
Devices using PCI to local bus bridges like the PLX PCI9030 should be usable.
Also, devices supporting version 2.3 or greater of PCI standard can make use
of the standard master interrupt enable/status bits in the control and status
registers.

@section udev UDEV rules

To allow IOCs to run with minimal privlages it is advisable to change the permissions
of the special files use by devlib2.
This can be done either manually, or by configuring the UDEV daemon.

When attempting to make use of a PCI devices, devlib2 will attempt to access several files.

@li /sys/bus/pci/devices/000:BB:DD.F/resource#

The "resource*" files exist one for each BAR.
devPCIToLocalAddr() will first attempt to open the corresponding file.

@li /sys/bus/pci/devices/000:BB:DD.F/uio:uio#  (Linux <= 2.6.28)
@li /sys/bus/pci/devices/000:BB:DD.F/uio/uio#  (Linux >= 2.6.32)

These are possible locations of symlinks to "/dev/uio#".
devPCIToLocalAddr() will next attempt to open each in turn,
then map the a region corresponding to the BAR number,
or the number of mappings when the DEVLIB_MAP_UIOCOMPACT flag is given.

In this example, the permissions of /resource0 are changed.

@code
SUBSYSTEM=="pci", ATTR{vendor}=="0x1234", ATTR{device}=="0x1234", RUN+="/bin/chmod a+rw %S%p/resource0"
@endcode

And for a UIO device

@code
SUBSYSTEM=="pci", ATTR{vendor}=="0x1234", ATTR{device}=="0x1234", MODE="0666"
@endcode

To discover possible attributes for matching use "udevadm info" and look for the first
SUBSYSTEM=="pci" paragraph.

@code
udevadm info -a -p $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/uio0) --attribute-walk
@endcode

If not device file exists, then the PCI geographic address can be used

@code
udevadm info -a -p /bus/pci/devices/0000:0b:00.0 --attribute-walk
@endcode

The effects of a new rules file can be tested with "udevadm -a add test".

@code
udevadm test -a add /bus/pci/devices/0000:0b:00.0
udevadm test -a add $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/uio0)
@endcode

/** @page exploreapp PCI driver/hardware development tool

@section exploreintro Purpose

The exploreApp support is intended as a tool to explore new PCI devices.
This may be useful when preparing to write a dedicated driver and/or
during development of PCI/PCIe device firmware.
exploreApp allows a PCI register to be read and/or written an EPICS record.
For example:

@code
record(longout, "pcitestout") {
  field(DTYP, "Explore Write32 LSB")
  field(OUT , "@8:0.0 bar=0 offset=0xc")
}
@endcode

The record @b pcitestout will be connected to the PCI device 8:0.0 (bus 8, device 0, function 0) with the first BAR.
A single write of 4 bytes is made when the record is processed.

The following can be added to some @b xyzApp/src/Makefile to include exploreApp.

@code
PROD_IOC += myioc
DBD += myioc.dbd
myioc_DBD += exploreSupport.dbd
myioc_LIBS += explorepci epicspci
@endcode

@section exploreopts Options

@b INP/OUT link strings may contain the following components

@li "bar=#" (default: 0)
@li "offset=#" in bytes (default: 0)
@li "mask=#" bit mask (default: 0 aka. no mask)
@li "shift=#" in bits (default: 0)
@li "step=#" in bytes (default: read size.  eg Read32 defaults to step=4)
@li "initread=1|0" bool (default: 1 for .OUT recordtypes, 0 otherwise)


For record types: @b longout, @b bo, @b mbbo, @b mbboDirect, @b ao
allowed @b DTYP are:

@li Explore Write8
@li Explore Write16 NAT
@li Explore Write16 LSB
@li Explore Write16 MSB
@li Explore Write32 NAT
@li Explore Write32 LSB
@li Explore Write32 MSB

For record types: @b longin, @b longout, @b bi, @b bo, @b mbbi, @b mbbo, @b mbbiDirect, @b mbboDirect, @b ai, @b ao

@li Explore Read8
@li Explore Read16 NAT
@li Explore Read16 LSB
@li Explore Read16 MSB
@li Explore Read32 NAT
@li Explore Read32 LSB
@li Explore Read32 MSB

The @b ao record type also accepts

@li Explore WriteF32 LSB
@li Explore WriteF32 MSB

The @b ai record type also accepts

@li Explore ReadF32 LSB
@li Explore ReadF32 MSB

The @b waveform record type accepts both integer Read and Write @b DTYP.
The @b step= link option may be applied to change how the address counter is incremented.
The default step size is the read size (eg. 4 for Read32).
A step size of 0 will read the base address @b NELM times.

@section exploreirq PCI Interrupt

Limited support of PCI interrupts is available on Linux only.
A @b longin record with DTYP="Explore IRQ Count" and SCAN="I/O Intr"
will be processed each time an interrupt occurs.

This requires that a UIO kernel module be installed.

@section explorefrib FRIB Specific

The DTYP="Explore FRIB Flash" support implements a FRIB specific protocol
for accessing a SPI flash chip over PCI.
The @b frib-flash.db file demonstrates use.
